# Projects by Hong Jing Jay

A portfolio of data analytics, machine learning, and dashboarding projects developed throughout academic studies, datathons, internships, and self-driven work. Highlights include forecasting models, sentiment & trend analysis, and interactive dashboards built with Power BI and Python.
**Note on Data Availability**  
These projects are shared to showcase my work in data analytics and machine learning.  
Please note that some Python/Jupyter notebooks may not be fully executable because the source datasets are not publicly available.  
Where possible, I’ve included sample outputs, visualizations, or descriptions of results to illustrate the outcomes.


## Technologies & Tools

- Languages: Python, SQL  
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (if used), BERT  
- Visualization / BI: Power BI, matplotlib / seaborn  
- Notebooks: Google Colab
- Others: SAS, data cleaning & governance practices etc.
